# Click Tiles

Click Tiles is an interactive web application built using React.js, HTML, SCSS, TypeScript, and Anime.js. It presents a grid of black clickable tiles covering the entire screen. Upon clicking any tile, it triggers a staggered animation effect, removing all tiles from the clicked one and revealing a developer quote atop a scrolling gradient background. Additionally, users can customize the background, which responds to mouse movements in a parallax-like manner.
